A frigid wasteland, full of dangers.

This mod is currently in development.

Take down the enemy. Destroy the bases. Weaken their grip on the Acropolis. Stop the enemies from destroying the world you live on.
A frontal attack on the base would be impossible. We have to weaken the base so we can attack.
You have little time before the core cracker fires, and all is lost... (It won't actually destroy your Serpulo bases, i don't know how to do that)
Good luck... you'll need it.

I, i like cannons, are the sole developer of the mod.
The code of this mod is written in HJSON exclusively. 
If you wish to use sprites or sounds from this mod, feel free! Just credit me because stealing is bad.
You can help me by posting suggestions or soundtracks (i need good music because I can't make it myself :|)

This is a work-in progress mod, so keep in mind that anything can change!
This is also my first mod, so don't expect anything too good.
